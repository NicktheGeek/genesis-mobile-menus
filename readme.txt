Creates mobile menu options for Genesis themes

== Description ==

Created 3 mobile menu options for Genesis child themes

* Select Menu
* Collapsable Menu
* Alternate Menu

Also creates a gmm_is_mobile() function which can be used with the widget logic (or similar) plugin to hide widgets such as the Custom Menu Widget which might be in the header right sidebar

The menu includes a "fail safe" option which can be enabled to create a CSS and JS solution instead of a PHP solution which might not work in certain caching environments


This plugin requires the [Genesis Theme Framework](http://studiopress.com/themes/genesis)
